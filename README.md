#### This is a fork of [decon1d](https://github.com/hughests/decon1d) with a few improvements:

 - updated to run under Python 3 and lmfit 0.9.10
 - added an option to fit using Gaussian curves instead of Lorentzian
 - added a csv file output
 - changed configuration variables so no changes need to be made to fit the included sample data. Just clone this repository and run `python decon_2.0.py`
